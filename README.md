start to code with swift, unit 7 assignment

Hello! My name is Zaynab, I am currently an undergrad at OSU studying Early Childhood Education. This summer, I am taking a swift programming course through OSU, and I've really enjoyed it thus far! I love hanging out with my younger siblings, reading, and being outdoors.
